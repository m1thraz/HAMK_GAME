I think I need to talk to my Son..

Son: Dad .. I’m feeling very very weak *cough*  *cough*.... my hands are so cold...
Dad: Oh no my son.. your disease is getting worse and worse… I .. I need to search for a healing spell in my magic scroll … 
Dad: But such a strong spell is forbidden, because it is against the laws of nature and belongs to black magic. I need to check my old scroll and search for something else.


*PlayerName*: There it is on the table, my old spell scroll.

It looks bad... I have to cast the forbidden spell, it's the only way not to lose my son....
But with this I put the village in danger, because I use the powers of the demons and to cast the spell I have to create a portal between the two worlds for a short time to concentrate enough energy for this spell....
I have to risk it or my son will die.

Demon: What a nice world here, thank you for opening the gates and for this delicious offering.
Dad: What who are you and what do you want from my son!!!
Son: Dad please help me... I'm scared.....
Demon: I gratefully accept this sacrifice. Muhahahahahaah
